== Introduction ==

*The problem:* the environmental transition requires us to make plans with numbers - numbers such as 'GHG emissions must be reduced by 5% every year' or 'the emissions from sea shipping should be halved by 2050'.

Currently, we're not very good as dealing with such numbers. This guide aims to provide everyone with intellectual tools that make this quantitative planning more straightforward in many situations, while requiring no more than elementary-school math.

The main notion we introduce is the *centibel*. The _centibel_ is a unit of measure for how much some quantity gets scaled or downscaled. It turns out that if we frame our objectives and opportunities in terms of centibels (as opposed to percentages or physical units), many GHG reductions problems become easy to work out and visualize.

**KEY TAKEWAY**

When emissions are decomposed into several factors, centibels measure emission reductions evenly across all factors.
====

[TIP]
====
**KEY TAKEWAY**

Centibels make it easier to plan emissions reductions as a measured combination of efficiency gains and sobriety, rather than an unrealistic binary choice between efficiency and sobriety.

In particular, using centibels tends to reveal the following challenge: _even highly-impressive enhancements in efficiency can leave significant work to sobriety._

====


=== Diminishing returns

.When reducing emissions, the first 10% of progress are usually much less expensive than the last. Centibels naturally account for this reality.
image::cb-rcpt-jumps.png[width=100%]


== Example: reducing emissions from cement ==

Assume that we want to reduce the CO₂ emissions from producing cement for construction : for example, we might aim to divide these emissions by 10 (-90%) on the long term, which corresponds exactly to a -100 cB target.

To model cement-production GHG emissions, we decompose them into the following factors:

1. **CO₂ intensity:** how much CO₂ is emitted from producing a ton of cement. (in tCO₂eq/t)
  - _**Influenced by:** production technology._
1. **Construction density:** how much cement we use per building area (in t/m²).
  - _**Influenced by:** architectural design._
1. **Usage:** how much we build (in m²).
  - _**Influenced by:** housing policies, lifestyle choices._

To be more explicit: in this model, CO₂ emissions are given by the following formula:

[latexmath]
++++
\text{CO₂ emissions} = \text{CO₂ intensity} \times \text{construction density} \times \text{usage}
++++

When using centibels, the above equation turns in to the 'budget problem' of splitting the -100cB reduction across our 3 factors. The following chart provides an example:

[#cement-economy-centibels]
.How various reduction actions might be combined to lowering emissions from cement (numbers chosen arbitrarily).
image::cement-economy-centibels.svg[width=100%]

[TIP]
====
**KEY TAKEWAY**

When expressed in centibels, emissions reduction objectives become a 'budget' problem: how many centibels are contributed by each factor.

This is not possible with percentages or tCO₂eq, because the reductions on individual factors are compounded.
====



== Example: emissions reduction pathway ==

[]
====

*Case study:* To have a good chance of limiting global warming to less than +2°C, we decide starting from now to *reduce GHG emissions at a rate of -6.4% every year.*

_By how much will we have reduced GHG emissions in 10 years?_

====

Most people will either tell you that they don't know, or give the instinctive but incorrect answer of -64%. Those few who can find the correct formula of latexmath:[100 \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{6.4}{100}\right)^{10}\right)] probably cannot compute it off the top of their heads. The fundamental issue here is that successive applications of percentages is tricky.

On the other hand, if we frame our objective as

[]
====
_We will reduce our GHG emissions by -2.89 cB/year_
====

anyone can tell that in 10 years, we will have reduced them by -28.9cB, from which you can quickly translate it to a -49% reduction. *In centibels, the correct calculation is the intuitive one.*



The advantage of centibels is even more evident when we reverse the problem:

[]
====
_If we aim for -48% GHG emissions in 10 years, by what fraction must we reduce them each year?_
====

At this point, only the scientifically trained have a chance of finding the correct formula of latexmath:[100 \times \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{48}{100}\right)^{\frac{1}{10}}\right)]. On the other hand, if I tell you that we aim for -28.4 cB in 10 years, you can easily tell that this translates to a reduction of -2.84 cB/year.


[TIP]
====
**KEY TAKEWAY**

Successive applications of percentages are arithmetically hard. Most people get them wrong.

In contrast, for same purpose, centibels require only basic additions and subtractions, the kind of which we use for everyday accounting.
====




=== How many centibels per year? ===

We mentioned a 'speed of decline' of GHG emissions of -2.89 cB/year. This section explains how to compute such a number.

At the time of writing, it is estimated that the world has a remaining https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2017/jan/19/carbon-countdown-clock-how-much-of-the-worlds-carbon-budget-have-we-spent['emissions budget'] of 646 GtCO2e to stay below +2°C of global warming.

Emissions reduction pathways are designed so as to not emit more than this 646 GtCO2e threshold in the future: the 'speed of decline' is computed accordingly, depending on when we start reducing emissions (the more we delay, the faster we will have to reduce emissions). The mathematics of the problem are too involved to derive here, but they yield the following rule:

[]
====
**Working out the required 'speed of decline' of GHG emissions, in cB/year**:

1. If we kept our current yearly emissions of https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/19/presentation.htm[42.1 GtCO2e/year], we would have exhausted our 646 GtCO2e carbon budget in 2036. **Let's call 2036 the _Pivot Year_** for global emissions.
2. **Constraint:** we must have reduced emissions by **-43.4 cB at the Pivot Year.** (-63.2%)footnote:[Note to scientists: -43.3 cB corresponds to a division by the mathematical constant e = 2.71828...]
====

So if we started reducing in 2021, this would mean a reduction of -43.4 cB in 15 years, i.e -2.89 cB/year (-6.45% every year).

If we delayed by 5 years and started reducing in 2026, this would be a much more challenging -4.34 cB/year (-9.52% every year).

image::exp-decay-global-pathways.svg[width=100%]

[TIP]
====
**KEY TAKEWAY**

Exponential-decay pathways, one of the most commonly used type of trajectories for communicating about emissions reduction, are easy to reason about in centibels: we remove the same number of centibels every year.

Thanks to the _"-43.3 cB at Pivot Year" rule,_ it's easy to keep track of the rate at which to reduce emissions (and how it grows as we delay).

====

[WARNING]
.The specific shape of the pathway is critical
====
The above 'target' of -43.4 cB only applies to 'constant centibels speed' reduction pathways (which consist of reducing emissions by the same numbers of centibels every year - known in the scientific community as _exponential decay pathways_). If the curve of our emissions doesn't follow rigourously this specific shape, especially in early years, this rule no longer works.

For example, in order to account for 'inertia' in yearly emissions, another approach is to plan reductions not at 'constant centibels speed', but at 'constant centibels _acceleration_': emissions then follow a 'half-bell curve' with a slower decline in early years and a more brutal 'landing' in late years. In this case, the Pivot Year target is -34.1 cBfootnote:[Note to scientists: -34.1 cB corresponds to a division by the mathematical constant latexmath:[e^{\frac{\pi}{4}}]]; starting the reductions in 2021 would then require an 'acceleration' of -0.303 cB/year².

== Example: the Kaya equation ==

The Kaya equation describes the GHG emissions of a society by decomposing them into the following 4 factors:

[latexmath]
++++
\text{GHG} = \frac{\text{GHG}}{E} \times \frac{E}{\text{GDP}} \times \frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Pop}} \times \text{Pop}
++++

The factors are:

* latexmath:[\text{Pop}] : the *population size* (in persons)
* latexmath:[\frac{\text{GDP}}{\text{Pop}}] : the *GDP per capita* (in $/person)
  - can be loosely interpreted as the average "standard of living" (how much economic production each person enjoys on average), with important caveats in said interpretation.
* latexmath:[\frac{E}{\text{GDP}}] : the *energy intensity of economic production* (in kWh/$)
  - in English: how much energy is needed to produce $1 of added value (on average).
* latexmath:[\frac{\text{GHG}}{E}] : the *carbon content of energy* (in gCO₂eq/kWh)
  - in English: how much CO₂ is emitted when consuming 1kWh of energy (on average).


Because the Kaya equation is a multiplicative chain, we can gain insights by discussing it in terms of centibels. Concretely, if we aim to reduce GHG emissions at a pace of -2.89 cB/year, then all 4 factors must vary each such that their variations sum to -2.89 cB/year.

Importantly, if some of the 4 factors are _increasing_ rather than decreasing, then they play adversarially to reducing GHG emissions, adding to the burden on the other factors.

For example, if GDP per capita increases by +1 cB/year, then the burden of reduction on the other 3 factors is now -3.89 cB/year. Likewise, a growing population adds to the challenge of reducing GHG emissions. This is illustrated in the following figure:

.Demographic and economic growth add to the speed requirements for the decarbonization of the economy
image::kaya-cB-degrowth.svg[]

Today, when discussing the environmental transition, the first two factors get most of the attention. For example, replacing fossil fuels with renewable or nuclear energy sources reduces latexmath:[\frac{\text{GHG}}{E}]. Likewise, making our economy more _energy-efficient_ (for example: replacing air travel with train travel, enhancing the fuel economy of cars, replacing radiators with heat pumps, or redirecting our leisure expenses from watching online video to reading books) reduces latexmath:[\frac{E}{\text{GDP}}].

You might think that achieving a fast pace of reduction on latexmath:[\frac{\text{GHG}}{E}] is easy, thanks to renewable energy sources: after all, the carbon content of wind electricity is a good -100 cB below that of coal, even when accounting for storage. But this analysis overlooks the following issues:

. Electricity production only accounts for about 40% of GHG emissions, and electrifying the other energy uses is much more work than just replacing power plants.
. The sheer scale of the electicity production to substitute is challenging in itself, posing in particular difficulties of material supply.
. About 30% of GHG emissions are not related to energy consumption at all (in particular from agriculture, as well as the cement and metallurgy industries).

Can we do something about latexmath:[\frac{E}{\text{GDP}}], i.e make our economies less energy-intensive? To some extent, we're already doing it: for example, https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/energy-intensity-of-economies[some estimations] show that latexmath:[\frac{E}{\text{GDP}}] has decreased at a pace of -0.8 cB/year from 2005 to 2015 at the global levelfootnote:[Some countries have sustained much faster reductions of latexmath:[\frac{E}{\text{GDP}}]; unfortunately, this often doesn't point us towards any sustainable direction, because these achievements are made possible by energy trade. For instance, from 1998 to 2008, Norway has decreased its latexmath:[\frac{E}{\text{GDP}}] at an impressive pace of -3.5 cB/year... mostly thanks to growing North sea oil exports, while their territorial energy consumption remained constant.].

People and governments tend to have strong feelings about demographic policies and economic growth; we will not debate here what objectives are acceptable regarding these factors, but it's important not to forget that they exist and can exert strong influence on GHG emissions, for better or for worse.


== Example: saving fuel on cargo ships ==

[]
====
You might have heard that a cargo ship consumes *less fuel when it goes more slowly*, which reduces GHG emissions.

However, reducing the speed of a cargo ship also reduces the _throughput_ at which it delivers goods, and so reducing speed will *increase the number of cargo ships at sea,* which increases GHG emissions.

_Can we tell which effect will win out? **Can we reduce GHG emissions by changing the speed of cargo ships?**_
====

We have the following *formulas for transportation throughput and GHG emissions:*

[latexmath]
++++
\text{transportation throughput} = A \times \text{fleet size} \times \text{ship speed}
++++


[latexmath]
++++
\text{GHG emissions} = B \times \text{fleet size} \times (\text{ship speed})^3
++++

in which latexmath:[A] and latexmath:[B] are constants which won't matter to us here.

From these formulas, any engineer can give you the following elements:

1. Increasing fleet size by +1 cB will *increase both throughput and GHG emissions by +1 cB*
2. Decreasing ship speed by -1 cB will *decrease throughput by -1 cB and GHG emissions by -3 cB*

From here, you can deduce that _**by trading -1 cB in ship speed for +1 cB in fleet size, you keep the same transportation throughput, while reducing GHG emissions by +1 -3 = -2 cB.**_

So the answer is: _yes_, reducing ship speed does reduce GHG emissions in spite of the increase in fleet size (hurray!). Notice that by framing the situation in terms of centibels, we made this opportunity easy to spot and work out.

For example, you can verify that a -10cB reduction in speed compensated by a +10cB increase in fleet size would translate to -20.6% in ship speed, +25.9% in fleet size, and -36.9% in GHG emissions from fuel consumption. In addition, compounding this approach with a _sobriety_ policy, we might not compensate all the way to +10cB in fleet size, in which case the GHG emissions would be even more reduced.

Of course, such a change would have drawbacks: for example personel costs would increase and sea voyages would last longer. But this is typically the sort of tradeoffs to be considered for the environmental transition.


[TIP]
====
**KEY TAKEWAY**

In some situations, the impact of reduction actions can become much easier to work out when quantifying them in centibels.
====



== Example: reducing emissions from driving cars ==

*Case study:* suppose we want to reduce the GHG emissions from driving individual cars.

On the long term, we want to divide said emissions by 10 (-90%), which corresponds exactly to a -100cB variation.

Following https://www.withouthotair.com/cA/page_254.shtml[MacKay], we model the problem by decomposing the car-driving emissions into the following **factors:**

1. **Engine carbon intensity:** how much CO₂ the engine emits per energy delivered. (in teqCO₂/kWh)
  - _**Influenced by:** engine technology, fuel production._
1. **Distance-wise displaced mass:** how much matter is set into motion per mile traveled (in ton/mile), through car acceleration or air resistance.
  - _**Influenced by:** vehicle weight, aerodynamic profile, distance between stops._
1. **Energy per displaced mass:** how much kinetic energy is spent per ton of displaced mass (in kWh/ton).
  - _**Influenced by:** driving speed._
1. **Usage:** how much we drive (in miles).
  - _**Influenced by:** lifestyle._

Importantly, as we make enhancements to reduce each factor, _**the effects multiply.**_ This might sound like good news, but it usually works to our disappointment: for example, if we reduced by 20% each of the 4 above-mentioned factors, the result would no be a -80% reduction of CO₂ emissions, but a more modest -59%, which would leave twice as much residual emissions.

When we frame the situation _**in centibels, these multiplications become additions,**_ which are easier to reason about and visualize. As an example, the following chart uses this fact to show how various reduction actions might contribute to lowering car-driving emissions:

[#cars-economy-centibels]
.How various reduction actions might be combined to lowering car-driving emissions (numbers chosen arbitrarily).

== Appendix: converting to / from centibels

Denoting latexmath:[p] the relative percentage (e.g -75%), latexmath:[s] the corresponding scaling factor (e.g latexmath:[\times \frac{1}{4}]), and latexmath:[c] the corresponding centibels (e.g -60.2 cB), we have the following *conversion formulas*:


[latexmath]
++++
s = 1 + \frac{p}{100}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
c = 100 \times \log(s)
++++

[latexmath]
++++
s = 10 ^{\frac{c}{100}}
++++

[latexmath]
++++
p = 100 \times (s - 1)
++++

Note that the first and last formulas are merely reminders about what relative percentages mean.

Here are screenshots of converting between centibels and relative percentages on the calculator app of an Android phone:

.A -17% variation translates to -8.09 cB.
image::example-computing-rcpt-to-cB.png[]

.A -38 cB variation translates to -58.3%.
image::example-computing-cB-to-rpct.png[]

Note that some computations involve a latexmath:[\log] function (pronounce: "logarithm"). There exist several logarithm functions; to make sure you're using the correct onefootnote:[known as the _base-10 logarithm_.], verify that latexmath:[\log(10) = 1].
